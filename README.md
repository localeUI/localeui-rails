The LocaleUIRails Gem is a Ruby on Rails application gem that provides developers with a seamless way to manage and synchronise translation files with LocaleUI.com. By integrating the Gem into the Rails application, translations can be automatically synchronised, updated and deployed directly to LocaleUI without manually uploading or copying language files.

The LocaleUI Rails Gem makes the management of multilingual Ruby on Rails applications uncomplicated and automated - ideal for companies that want to offer their Ruby on Rails application in different languages.
